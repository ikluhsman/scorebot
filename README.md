Scorebot is an easy-to-use score card for keeping score of card games, darts, dominoes, dice, or any other game where you keep a basic running total of points. The demo is available at [https://scorebot.app](https://scorebot.app). 

1. When you get to the page you'll find a blank scoreboard.

1. Click the user with the + sign in the upper-right corner to add players to the score board.

1. Enter scores for each player.

1. When you're done with the game, click the save button on the button bar. A link will be generated so you can re-load your game later. Keep the link in case you want to remember your game.

Tips:

* You can double-click each player name to change the name of the players, click on the game name to change it, or click on goal to change the winning point goal.
* As you enter scores, the current leader will be shown and if you have set a winning goal, the winner will be highlighted when they reach the goal.
* The winner can gloat by saving a link and sharing it on social media with other players.
* Make sure to save frequently, and keep the link to the final game somewhere so you can get back to it easily.
* CAUTION: If you refresh your browser your game will revert back to the last saved snapshot. Save frequently!
